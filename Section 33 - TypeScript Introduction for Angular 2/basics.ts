//* Basic types in TypeScript.
//* Primitives: number, string, boolean
//* More complex types: arrays, objects
//* Function types, parameters

//* Primitives
//* We need to write in lower case.
let age: number;
age = 12;

let userName: string;
userName = 'David';

let isInstructor: boolean;
isInstructor = true;

//* More Complex Types
//* This is how we define an array of strings.
//* We can't use let hobbies: string; because it will store a single value.
let hobbies: string[];
