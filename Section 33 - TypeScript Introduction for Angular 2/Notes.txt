TypeScript Introduction
Extending JavaScript

What is TypeScript and Why do we need to use it?
    TypeScript is a "superset" to JavaScript.
    The base JavaScript code (all) doesn't change.
    TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript.
    JavaScript on its on is dinamically typed.

Installing and using TypeScript
    npm install typescript
    TypeScript doesn't run in the browser, TypeScript should be compiled to JavaScript.
    In the compilation time we will get errors provided by TypeScript.
    The compiled code will run in the browser.
    Even if the TypeScript file has errors, it will create the JavaScript file.
