How Angular App gets Loaded and started
    To modify the basic layout we can code in app.component.html
    The file served by the server is the index.html (Single Page Application).
    <app-root></app-root> is the tag where our components will be loaded.
    The folder app is the root application.

    app.component.ts, we have component decorator, inside we have the selector property with app-root, it is where our component will be loaded.

How is Angular triggered?
    In the index.html file at the end (using developer tools), some bundles are created with scripts, with our code.
    The main.ts is the first code to be triggered.
    In the line bootstrapModule(AppModule), it is imported from AppModule (/app/app.module), this is part of the root component in the folder app (app.module.ts).

Components are Important!
    Reminder: Angular in the end is a JavaScript framework, changing your DOM (HTML) at runtime!.
    Components are a key feature in Angular.
    We can build our app using many components.
    We have the root component and over this we can add more components.
    Example: the header can be a component, the main area could be another component, the sidebar could be another component, etc.
    It allows us to split our application in reusable parts.

Creating a new Component
    The other components won't be loaded into index.html, it will be loaded into app.component.html
    Inside src/app we can create our folders with components.
    Naming convention name.component.extension
    A component is a TypeScript class.

Create a new component using the CLI
    ng generate component servers
    ng g c servers
    We will have the new component similar to app component.
    The file servers.component.spec.ts is for testing purposes.

What is DataBinding?
    Databinding = Communication
    TypeScript code -> Output Data -> Template HTML
    Output data:
        String Interpolation {{ data }}
        Property Binding ([property] = "data")
    React to (user) events
        Event Binding ((event) = "expression")
    Combination of both: Two-way-binding ([ngModel] = "data")

What are directives.
    Directives are instruction in the DOM.
    Example:
    <p appTurnGreen>My green Text</p>
    We can add the selector inside Directive.

Using nglf to output data conditionally
    It works like an IF statement.
