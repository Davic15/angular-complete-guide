What is Angular?
    Angular is a JavaScript Framework which allows you to create
    reactive Single-Page-Applications (SPAs).

    A single HTML file with different pieces of code that react to the
    user activity.

    The url change, but the page never reloads. We are changing the currently
    loaded page.

Angular Versioning
    AngularJS (Angular 1).
    Angular 2 (Complete re-write).
    Angular 3 (It was skipped).
    Angular 10, 11, 12, etc (New version every 6 months. Small, incremental, backwards-compatible changes)

    The big difference is between AngularJS (Angular 1) and Angular 2.

    We are going to use Angular 2+;

    From Angular 2, all version are named Angular 2.
