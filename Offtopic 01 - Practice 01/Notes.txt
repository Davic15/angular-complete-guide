    Command Line Interface Tool.
    It Allows to work with angular, add components, etc.
    ng generate [component | directive | etc].
    ng g (it is the short version).

Angular Project Files Overview
    When we create a project we can see different files and/or folders.
    tslint.json: coding rules (consistence between team, example: use == or ===);
    tsconfig.json: configuration file for TypeScript.
    package.json: dependencies.
    package-lock.json: have the same version used to create the project.
    karma.conf.js: this is for unit testing.
    README.md: just the readme file.
    gitignore: files and folders ignore by git.
    angular.json: Important!. This control stuffs like where is the code, where to build the code, etc.
    src: source folder.
    src/app: folder for the app we are building.

The big Picture.
    Type of application what we can build.
    Angular is like Lego, we have different part and we can build to create something big (our final app).
    We have for example: header component, footer component, menu component, list component, and we can change the list component for a grid component.
    We will use TypeScript a superset of JavaScript.
    The framework (Angular) is written using TypeScript.

    Components (UI Code).
    Services (Reusable Code) (Validation, HTTP, websockets).
    Modules (Organize Code) (Components and Services should be registered or declared in Modules).

    Module -> Component -> (HTML Template / Code -> Service).

    App Module (@NgModule) -> Routes (Change in the URL) -> Component (HTML Template -> Directives/Components and Code -> Service)
    We can use more modules too.

Overview - Angular Components & Modules.
    Angular will use at least one Module.
    Components are HTML and Code.

    What is a component?
    Building a block of Angular.
        Made of Code and HTML template.
            It has a "selector" <app-customers></app-customers>
    
    What's in Component Code?
    Imports (functionalities what we need).
    Decorator (metadata about the component).
    Class (This is the actual code, render in the UI).
    
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-customers',
        templateUrl: './customers.component.html'
    })

    Export allows to other file to import the current code below.
    export class CustomersComponent {

    }

    What is a Module?
    Module acts as a way to organize components and services into reusable functionality.

App Component - Angular Components & Modules.

App Module - Angular Components and Modules.
    main.ts runs first.

The Customers Component - Angular Components and Modules
    ng generate component customers -d (dry run).
